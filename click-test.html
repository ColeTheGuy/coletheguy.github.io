        <p>Test how fast you can click with Cole's CPS test!</p>
        <h3>What is CPS?</h3>
        <p>CPS, also an acronym for "Clicks Per Second", is a stat of a sort that shows how fast you can click. This can be helpful when playing a first person shooter game, such as Minecraft, especially during a fight, when timing is of upmost importance.</p>
        <h3>Why do I need it?</h3>
        <p>As I said before, in Minecraft PvP, timing is of upmost importance. The reason faster clicking is important is because it's almost always about who attacks first. When you have a faster CPS than your opponent, you are able to hit sooner than your opponent when they enter your range, giving you the tactical advantage.</p>
