        <h2>Tools</h2>
        <p>A variety of simple little tools created by Ducky.</p>

        <p>index2txt &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - <a href="files/index2txt.exe" style="color: greenyellow; font-weight: bold;">COMPLETE</a> (redesigning in the future with GUI)<p>
        <p>convert2youtube - <span style="color: yellow; font-weight: bold;">IN PROGRESS</span><p>
        <p><i>...and much more in the near future!</i></p>
        <p><br></p>
        <h3>index2txt</h3>
        <p>A simple console program that will give you a .txt file listing all of your files in a certain folder considering given arguments. This program will be rewritten once I have a better understanding of Java. The rewritten version will also be compatible with MacOS and Linux as well!</p>
        <h3>convert2youtube</h3>
        <p>A simple GUI program that will convert any video given from any filetype and codec to an H.264 codec in a .mp4 container (youtube standard filetype). This is basically a GUI for ffmpeg, but makes it much easier to use, and doesn't require any complicated installation or knowledge on ffmpeg.</p>
