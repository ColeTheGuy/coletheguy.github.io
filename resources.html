        <p>This is my resources page. I will link all the things I find are the best in that catagory and include a couple of opinions.</p>

        <p>As a person who loves chiptune music, I had to share this resource. I love chiptune music because I love retro-sounding, video game music, and 8-bit music, or chiptune music, definitly gives off that retro-y vibe. Opinions aside, I used to use <a href="https://8bc.org/">8bitcollective</a>, which was not only one of the hugest collections of chiptune music out there, but all the music was free to download! Unfortunately, their site is down. It has been since 2012. Luckily, some kind people at <a href="http://2xaa.fm/">2xAA</a>, another big name when it comes to chiptnue music, were able to release an archive of the collection <a href="http://brkbrkbrk.com/8bcdump/">here</a>, just like the old one. You can now get back to enjoying those 5-channel songs!</p>
