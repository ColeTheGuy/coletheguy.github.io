	    <h2>Balisong:</h2>
	    <p>The balisong (more commonly known in the US as butterfly knife) buisness is kind of wierd. There's a total of about 5 main brands that make them, most of them only making a few models that are usually super over-priced. The problems with all of the &quot;trainers&quot; you find on Amazon are that either one, they get taken down because Amazon doesn't like selling weapons, or two, they fall apart really easy. Now, if you aren't quite sure if you want one, go ahead and get one of those to try out and learn some tricks! The problem with them is that they usually fall apart and dont feel smooth at all.</p>
    <h2>Headphones:</h2>
        <img align="left" src="images/arctis5.png" width="100" height="100">
      <p>First topic on this page: headphones. As a person who loves video games, not only is it good to have good sound, but also a good microphone to communicate with others. After looking around for a while, I've come to the conclusion that the <a href="https://steelseries.com/gaming-headsets/arctis-5">Arctis 5</a> by <a href="https://steelseries.com/">SteelSeries</a> is by far one of the best set of headphones I've ever come across. Not only does it have sound quality of studio headphones (which can end up costing up to $2,000), but also a microphone with ClearCast technology, a technology that cancels out most noise around you automatically. (They have a whole article explaining how it works <a href="https://steelseries.com/blog/the-miseducation-of-gaming-headset-mics">here</a>) It doesn't end there either. The headphones have slick design, crazy comfort from the &quot;ski goggle&quot; headband, and even RGB lighting, something only dreamed of by some. For only $100, I think this product is definitly worth the money.</p>
<h2>Laptop:</h2>
<img align="right" src="images/aspiree15.png" width="100" height="100">
<p>When it comes down to it, most computers within my price range just don't have the power I want. I hate buying a product just to find that there was a different product that's cheaper and has quality equivelent to, or ever better than the one I just got. After quite a bit of searching, I think I found the laptop that no one can top in price-to-quality. The Acer Aspire E 15 by <a href="https://www.acer.com/">Acer</a>, specifically the <a href="https://www.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/model/NX.GHGAA.004">E5-575G-57D4</a> model, is definitely worth the money. Coming in at less than $600, it works as an amazing computer for all purposes. You probably know by now that I like to game, and this computer definitely works for me. Though it may not be able to play the on crazy graphics, it can run almost all of the modern games with amazing performance. The one downside I would say I have with this laptop is it's storage. Only having 256GB won't help me a whole ton when I want to try to download all of my games, or maybe sync my music. The upside of this is the type of storage system: an SSD. This is significant because SSD are proven to run up to 10x faster than an HDD, so you'll be getting some pretty fast boot times. This is the ultimate dream laptop for budget gamers, hands down.</p>
<h2>Mouse:</h2><img align="left" src="images/sabre.png" width="100" height="100">
<p>The problem is, when we talk about gaming equipment, people tend to think that things should cost more than they normally should. For example, I've seen tons of gaming pcs that end up costing over $2,000, along with gaming mice, that can cost around $200. In my opinion, this is ridiculous! I understand that gaming equipment usually tends to be much better in quality than normal equipment for just browsing the internet, but it shouldn't need to cost $1,000 more! I think that <a href="http://www.corsair.com/">Corsair</a> proves this with their <a href="http://www.corsair.com/en-us/sabre-rgb-gaming-mouse">Sabre</a> gaming mouse. Costing only $50, this mouse has RGB lighting that you can customize, 10,000 dpi, and decent weight. It's everything on your $200 mouse, but $150 cheaper. I can say with confidence that this is one of the best budget gaming mice out there.</p>
