        <h1>Resources</h1>
        <p>Now, you might be wondering: "Where does such a stupid kid get such amazing resources?" Well, I present to you the "Resources" page! ...so that you don't look as stupid as me anymore! ...because...it's miserable...</p>
        <p>...can you give me a second to go cry in that corner?</p>

        <p>You should know by now, after going through my hideous home page, that I <strong>LOVE</strong> chiptune music. This is with good reason too; as I love retro. And 8-bit music, or chiptune music, definitly gives that retro-y vibe. Opinions aside, I used to use <a href="https://8bc.org/">8bitcollective</a>, which was not only one of the hugest collections of chiptune music out there, but all the music was free to download! Unfortunately, their site is down. It has been since 2012. Luckily, some kind folks at <a href="http://2xaa.fm/">2xAA</a> were able to release an archive of the collection <a href="http://brkbrkbrk.com/8bcdump/">here</a>, just like the old one.</p>
