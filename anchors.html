        <h1>Anchors, and why they're useful.</h1>
        <p>A quick and terribly written document by Ducky.</p>
        <br><br><br>
        <p>Anchors are like pre-made bookmarks that you can attach to almost any element. You can set a name for each of these "bookmarks", and it will jump down to them. For example, I'm going to set a bunch of new lines so you have to scroll to the next thing, but who wants to do that? Just click <a href="#link1">here</a>.</p>
        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
        <h1><a name="link1">Bang! You just jumped to here!</a></h1>
        <p>Now wasn't that just useful?</p>
        <br><br><br>
        <p>People use anchors all the time, whether it be to organize a long document, or just plainly because they don't want to make seperate pages. Wanna learn how to use them? Well, why don't we use one to take you there? <a href="#link2">Let's go!</a></p>
        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
        <h1><a name="link2">Here we are! Now let's get to coding an anchor!</a></h1>
        <br><br><br>
        <p>First, find an element that you want to make an anchor for. Usually you will use some text element, so to do this, put <i>&#60OriginalElement&#62;&#60;a name="WhateverYouWantToNameTheAnchor"&#62;TextFromOriginalElement&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/OriginalElement&#62;</i>. This will keep the same appearance of the element, but set an anchor on the element, so if you link to it, it knows where to go.</p>
        <p>Now you need someway to get to it. Type <i>&#60a href="<u>#</u>WhateverYouWantToNameTheAnchor"&#62;LinkText&#60a/a&#62;</i>. Notice that you need a # in the link for your website to recognize it as an anchor, but you don't need one when setting the anchor in our earlier step. This entire example creates a anchor named "WhateverYouWantToNameTheAnchor", and has a link that jumps to it with the text "LinkText". Pretty easy, huh?
